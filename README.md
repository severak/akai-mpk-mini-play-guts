# guts of AKAI MPK mini play

*an attempt to enhance AKAI MPK mini play (OG version)*

I have an original AKAI MPK mini play keyboard. My feeling about it are little conflicted - I like it's simplicity, portable form factor and wide pallette of sounds. But there are some annoying things:

- I am not able to set velocity curve for keys (or set keys to full velocity)
- organ patches are velocity sensitive (which makes no sense)
- it's not possible to set BPM speed via numbers (only via tap tempo
- in some patches reverb and chorus set to zero can mute the sound itself (not sure which patch it was)

Good thing that these things got fixed in later revisions of keyboard. But I don't want new hardware, I want firmware update!

I wish I was able to somewhat hack firmware in my unit. Even setting organ patches to full velocity would improve usage experience so much.
